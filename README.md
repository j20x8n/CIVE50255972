Rationale 
Coursework 1 relates to the design of a Reinforced Concrete slender column. This is self-taught exercise, designed to assess independent learning. You are first required to read the handout on R.C column design to EC2 (based on the guidance provided by Mosley, Bungey and Hulse) provided on Minerva. Independent learning is an essential learning outcome for Masters level students as defined in UK-SPEC. UK-SPEC defines the Engineering Council’s requirements for engineering Master’s graduates in the UK.
Learning outcomes being assessed
Understand and apply the design guidance used in current codes of practice for the design of slender reinforced concrete columns.
Apply a comprehensive knowledge of mathematics, materials and their behaviour, and engineering principles to the solution of complex reinforced concrete design and analysis problems.
Formulate and analyse complex structural engineering design problems to reach substantiated conclusions. This will involve evaluating available data using fundamental engineering principles and judgment (both existing and new) to work with information that may be uncertain or incomplete and discussing the limitations of the techniques employed. Select and apply appropriate computational and analytical techniques to model complex reinforced concrete design problems and discuss the limitations of these techniques.
Evaluate the environmental and societal impact of solutions to complex design problems, optimising the design solutions to minimise these adverse impacts.
Assignment Guidance
·   Coursework 1 is a MAJOR item of coursework and must be submitted to the School in the usual way on or before TBC. (Note: any special arrangements for the submission of coursework previously agreed with part-time students will also apply to this work).
·   Assessment No.1 is on R.C Column Design to EC2. This is worth up to 25% of the total mark awarded for Advanced Concrete Design.
·   Each Coursework must be submitted separately   with the School’s standard cover sheet for a MAJOR item of coursework. This question paper must also be included as part of the submission.
·   Feedback on your performance will be given in the form. of brief general comments to the cohort plus a mark for each item of work. These will be issued on TBC.
Assessment Criteria and process
1.	Having read the design guidance (provided separately), you are to design a symmetrically reinforced concrete column to carry the following design ultimate load effects:
Axial Load = 1950 kN
End moment at top of column = 105 kNm
End moment at base of column = 0
Bending is about one axis only (i.e. the column is not subjected to biaxial bending).
2.	The column is to be designed to comply with the requirements of BS EN 1992-1-1 (EC2).
3.	It may be assumed that the column does not experience any sway effects. The effective heights of the column can be taken as 7.5m about both axes (i.e. ley   = lez   = 7.5m)
4.	You may assume that the creep coefficient, Фef   = 0.9.
5.	You are to make reasonable assumptions about any material parameters used in your design. Please note that any such assumptions must be clearly stated in your design calculations. It is entirely up to you to decide on the cross-sectional dimensions of the column and the area of reinforcement. You are required to produce a design that is sustainable and also considers economy, buildability, durability and safety (under all credible situations).
6.	It is likely that you will consider more than one size of column for this exercise to be able to demonstrate that your final design satisfies the requirements in Point 5 (you need to define what you mean by sustainable, economic etc). If this is the case, you are required to submit the full calculations for only one set of cross-sectional dimensions, however, you may include the results   for other cross-sections you have considered (but not full sets of calculations for each case). However, these results must have sufficient detail to confirm that the additional calculations have been completed.
7.	Your calculations should be supported by good   quality hand drawn sketches where appropriate. In addition, at the end of your calculations, you are required to present an elevation of the column (giving an indication of its location and relationship to the horizontal spanning elements) you have designed and   a number of cross-sections showing the layout of any reinforcement (including links); the cover to the reinforcement and the main dimensions must be provided. Either good quality hand drawings or AutoCAD drawings will be acceptable for these elevation and cross sections.Coursework Assessment Grid – Assignment 1 (Column Design)
